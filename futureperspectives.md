### Here are some potential uses of drone data I’d like to work on!

+ Nano-products development will continue to grow as reduction in quantity means a cost reduction, plus it is safer and more efficient. Drones use as applicators must be encouraged, they are able to cover larger areas and require less quantity of agro-chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, etc.). For this, work need to be done in terms of drones detection of crop’s needs and indexes needs to be develop and tuned for this purpose. 

+ Sensor development: A lot of efforts need to be put in for developing sensors for both ground-based (proximal) and aerial (remote sensors) for monitoring of nutrients, soil moisture, pests and disease detection, Wireless sensors will ultimately hold the key for precise nutrient and water application and, therefore, for their sustained long-term under field conditions, energy efficient protocols need to be developed (Sharma et al., 2016; Krishnan et al., 2021; Vidhya and Sakthivel, 2021; Karimi et. al. 2022).

+ Functional use of drones would be cost-effective and eco-friendly. UAVs Drones can quickly identify within field variations in nutrient status, pest infestation and disease initiation so that timely action can be taken. Algorithms for nutrients, weeds, pest and diseases identification need to be tuned.
